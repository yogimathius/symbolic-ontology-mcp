# Testing Summary

This document summarizes the current state of testing in the Symbol Ontology MCP Server project after recent improvements.

## Test Coverage Status

| Component                 | Test Status | Type of Tests            |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| Domain models             | ✅ Good     | Unit tests               |
| API endpoints             | ✅ Good     | Unit + Integration tests |
| MCP methods               | ✅ Good     | Unit tests               |
| Infrastructure (Memory)   | ⚠️ Limited  | Unit tests               |
| Infrastructure (Postgres) | ✅ Added    | Integration tests        |
| Configuration             | ✅ Good     | Unit tests               |
| Documentation             | ✅ Good     | Doc tests                |

## Recent Improvements

1. **Added PostgreSQL Repository Tests**

   - CRUD operation tests to validate create, read, update, delete functionality
   - Search functionality tests to ensure proper filtering and retrieval
   - Error handling tests to confirm proper error conditions
   - Tests designed to be skippable if no database available

2. **Fixed Doc Tests**

   - Fixed imports in library documentation example
   - Fixed trace_layer example with proper imports and type annotations

3. **Comprehensive Gap Analysis**

   - Created detailed `COVERAGE_GAPS.md` documenting test coverage across components
   - Prioritized areas for improvement
   - Set coverage targets for each component

4. **Fixed Existing Test Issues**
   - Resolved failing test for default configuration

## Testing Approach

Our testing approach follows these principles:

1. **Unit Tests for Core Domain Logic**

   - Each model has dedicated tests
   - Tests include validation of properties and methods
   - Boundary conditions are tested

2. **Integration Tests for End-to-End Flows**

   - API handlers tested with actual requests
   - Repository implementations tested with proper data flows
   - MCP method implementations tested

3. **Resilient Test Design**
   - Tests for external dependencies (like PostgreSQL) are designed to skip gracefully if not available
   - Test data is isolated using UUIDs to prevent conflicts
   - Each test cleans up after itself

## Running Tests

### Basic Test Run

```bash
cargo test
```

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Run tests for a specific module
cargo test domain::symbols

# Run the PostgreSQL repository tests
cargo test infrastructure::postgres_repository_tests
```

### Database Setup for Tests

PostgreSQL repository tests require a database. Set up with:

```bash
# Set up a test database
docker-compose up -d
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/symbol_ontology_test
```

## Next Steps

Based on the comprehensive gap analysis in `COVERAGE_GAPS.md`, our next priorities are:

1. Complete test coverage for memory repository implementation
2. Add more test cases for error handling in MCP methods
3. Implement and test pagination support
4. Add performance tests for large result sets

## Conclusion

The recent testing improvements have established a strong foundation for ensuring code quality in the Symbol Ontology MCP Server. By focusing on both unit and integration tests, we can maintain confidence in the correctness of the codebase as it evolves.

The comprehensive gap analysis provides a roadmap for further testing improvements to reach our coverage goals.
