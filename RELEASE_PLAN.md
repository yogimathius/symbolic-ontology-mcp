## Accomplishments (2024-08-20)

Today we made significant progress on refactoring the Symbol Ontology project:

1. **Structure and Initial Setup**

   - Created the workspace structure with multiple crates
   - Set up the core domain models in ontology-core
   - Moved repository interfaces and DB schema to ontology-core
   - Created a basic API server with symbol endpoints
   - Implemented MCP client with API connectivity

2. **Refactoring Progress**

   - Renamed dream-mcp-client to symbol-mcp-client
   - Renamed dream references in main configuration files
   - Implemented appropriate license headers
   - Created scripts for checking remaining references
   - Documented the new architecture and structure

3. **Next Steps**
   - Continue eliminating dream references (from tests, docs, and remaining source files)
   - Move DB repository implementations to ontology-core
   - Move API handlers and routes from src/api/ to ontology-api-server
   - Move MCP service logic from src/mcp/ to symbol-mcp-client
   - Implement authentication for the API server
   - Create comprehensive tests for the new structure
