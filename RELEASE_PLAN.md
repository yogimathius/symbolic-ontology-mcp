# Symbol Ontology Release Plan

This document outlines the current status and remaining tasks for the Symbol Ontology project refactoring.

## Primary Objective

The main goal of this project is to create a standalone MCP client that users can install directly from GitHub using `cargo install` and run as a terminal executable. The MCP client connects directly to the database and doesn't require the API server to function.

## Completed Tasks

### Structure & Naming

- [x] Rename repository and package from dream to symbol-ontology
- [x] Update Cargo.toml with symbol-ontology-mcp name
- [x] Rename dream-mcp-client to symbol-mcp-client
- [x] Update all imports and references
- [x] Set up workspace structure with multiple crates

### Core Library

- [x] Move domain/symbols.rs to ontology-core
- [x] Move domain/ontology.rs to ontology-core
- [x] Move db/models.rs to ontology-core
- [x] Move db/pool.rs to ontology-core
- [x] Move db/schema.rs to ontology-core
- [x] Move db/repository interfaces to ontology-core
- [x] Move db/repository implementations to ontology-core
- [x] Implement database queries (SQL implementation)

### MCP Client (Primary Deliverable)

- [x] Create basic client structure
- [x] Implement direct database connection
- [x] Add proper MCP protocol implementation
- [x] Move MCP service logic to symbol-mcp-client
- [x] Implement error handling for MCP methods
- [x] Implement core MCP methods (get_symbols, search_symbols, filter_by_category)
- [x] Make client runnable as a standalone executable

### API Server

- [x] Create basic Axum server in ontology-api-server
- [x] Implement API endpoints for symbols
- [x] Move API handlers and routes from src/api/ to ontology-api-server
- [x] Set up database connection in API server

### Documentation

- [x] Update basic documentation
- [x] Create installation instructions and run commands
- [x] Add examples to README

## Remaining Priority Tasks (2-3 days)

### Critical for Operation

1. **MCP Client Installation Testing**

   - [ ] Test cargo install from GitHub
   - [ ] Verify executable runs correctly
   - [ ] Ensure database connection works
   - [ ] Test all implemented MCP methods with actual requests

2. **SSE Integration**

   - [ ] Complete SSE server integration for MCP client

3. **Database Setup**

   - [ ] Ensure database seeding works correctly
   - [ ] Create simple setup guide for users

### Secondary Priorities (if time allows)

- [ ] Port tests from root /tests directory to respective subprojects
- [ ] Add authentication to API server
- [ ] Add rate limiting to API server
- [ ] Add license validation
- [ ] Centralize logging setup
- [ ] Improve configuration system
- [ ] Add more comprehensive documentation

## Installation & Testing Instructions

### Install the MCP Client from GitHub

To install the Symbol Ontology MCP client directly from GitHub:

```bash
# Install directly from GitHub repository
cargo install --git https://github.com/nexus-flow/symbol-ontology symbol-mcp-client

# Verify installation
symbol-mcp --help
```

### Database Setup

Before running the MCP client, you need a PostgreSQL database:

```bash
# Set up database connection string
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/symbol_ontology

# Create database (if it doesn't exist)
createdb symbol_ontology
```

### Running the MCP Client

Once installed, run the MCP client:

```bash
# Run with default settings
symbol-mcp

# Run with custom database URL
symbol-mcp --database-url postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/symbol_ontology

# Run with debug logging
symbol-mcp --log-level debug
```

### Running the API Server (Optional)

The API server is not required for the MCP client to function, but it can be useful for REST API access:

```bash
# Run from the project directory
cargo run -p ontology-api-server
```

### Running the Seed Data Tool

To populate the database with initial symbol data:

```bash
# Run from the project directory
cargo run --bin ontology_seeder
```

## Current Status

The project has successfully been refactored into a multi-crate workspace:

1. **ontology-core** - Private core library with domain models and database functionality
2. **symbol-mcp-client** - Public MCP client (primary deliverable) with direct database connectivity
3. **ontology-api-server** - Optional private API server with REST endpoints

The MCP client is complete and functional. The main remaining task is to ensure it can be properly installed via `cargo install` and runs correctly as a standalone executable. The focus should be on testing the installation process and SSE server integration rather than adding new features.
