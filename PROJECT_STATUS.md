# Dream Ontology MCP Server: Feature Status Report

## Current Feature Status

### Core Domain Model

- ✅ Symbol and SymbolSet domain models implemented
- ✅ Repository interfaces defined with proper error handling
- ✅ Basic symbol properties: id, name, category, description, interpretations, related_symbols

### Data Storage

- ✅ In-memory repository implementation for development/testing
- ✅ PostgreSQL repository implementation with basic CRUD operations
- ✅ Database schema with tables for symbols and symbol sets
- ⚠️ Vector embedding support mentioned but not fully implemented

### MCP Protocol Implementation

- ✅ Basic MCP tools implemented:
  - `get_symbols`: List symbols or filter by category
  - `search_symbols`: Text-based symbol search
  - `filter_by_category`: Category-based filtering
  - `get_categories`: List available categories
- ✅ RMCP SDK integration for MCP protocol compliance
- ⚠️ Error handling structured but not fully consistent across methods

### HTTP API

- ✅ Axum server with basic endpoints
- ✅ CORS and logging middleware
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ⚠️ Limited RESTful API endpoints (mentioned in README but implementation not extensive)

### Data Seeding

- ✅ Test data seeding via repository factories
- ✅ JSON data seeding from files
- ✅ Database seeder utilities mentioned, with separate binary targets

### Testing

- ✅ Integration test setup for MCP methods
- ✅ Test coverage setup with cargo-tarpaulin
- ✅ CI integration for test coverage reports
- ⚠️ Limited test coverage, especially for infrastructure components

## Areas for Improvement

### Code Organization and Documentation

1. **Inconsistent documentation**: Some files are well-documented with detailed comments, while others lack sufficient documentation.
2. **Code duplication**: The MCP method handlers contain duplicated code patterns that could be refactored.
3. **Error handling inconsistency**: Multiple error types and conversion implementations that could be streamlined.

### Feature Completion

1. **Vector embedding implementation**: The vector embedding support mentioned in the README exists in the database schema but isn't fully implemented in the repository.
2. **Missing LLM integration**: The README mentions LLM integration but doesn't specify how it works beyond using MCP.
3. **Limited test coverage**: More unit and integration tests needed, especially for repository implementations.

### Performance and Scalability

1. **Connection pooling**: Basic connection pooling exists but lacks configuration options.
2. **Caching**: No caching mechanism implemented for frequently accessed symbols.
3. **Full-text search**: The search functionality is basic and could be enhanced with proper full-text search.

### Other Gaps

1. **Deployment documentation**: Missing detailed deployment instructions beyond Docker setup.
2. **API versioning**: No versioning strategy for the API endpoints.
3. **Authentication/Authorization**: No security implementation for the API or MCP endpoints.
4. **Rate limiting**: No protection against API abuse.
5. **Metrics and observability**: Limited instrumentation for monitoring.

## Recent Improvements

1. **Test Coverage Reporting**: Added cargo-tarpaulin integration for generating test coverage reports. This includes:
   - A shell script for generating HTML and XML reports
   - GitHub Actions workflow for CI integration with Codecov
   - Documentation in README.md about how to run and interpret coverage reports

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Complete vector embedding support**: Finish implementing the vector search capabilities to enable semantic search.
2. **Enhance test coverage**: Add more unit and integration tests for all components to reach the 70% coverage threshold.
3. **Refactor error handling**: Create a unified error handling approach across the codebase.
4. **Implement proper full-text search**: Enhance the search capabilities using PostgreSQL's full-text search or similar.
5. **Complete HTTP API endpoints**: Implement comprehensive RESTful API endpoints for all operations.
6. **Add authentication/authorization**: Implement security mechanisms for API access control.
7. **Improve documentation**: Standardize documentation across all modules and provide better usage examples.
8. **Performance optimization**: Add caching and optimize database queries for better performance.
9. **Metrics and monitoring**: Implement proper observability for production deployment.
10. **API versioning**: Create a versioning strategy for the API to ensure backward compatibility.
