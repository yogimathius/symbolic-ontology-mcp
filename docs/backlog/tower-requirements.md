# Tower Integration Requirements (BACKLOG)

This document outlines the requirements for integrating the Tower middleware framework into the Dream Ontology MCP project. Tower is a powerful middleware framework for Rust HTTP services that integrates well with Axum.

## Why Tower?

Tower provides a standardized, composable middleware architecture that can help us implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, rate limiting, and more. These features will be particularly important as we build out the full functionality of the symbolic reasoning server.

## Core Tower Concepts

1. **Middleware Abstraction**: Tower standardizes the concept of "middleware" - code that sits between your application logic and the HTTP transport layer.

2. **Service Trait**: The core abstraction in Tower is the `Service` trait, which defines a type that can process requests asynchronously.

3. **Layer Pattern**: Tower uses the "layer" pattern to compose middleware, allowing you to stack multiple middleware components.

4. **Integration with Axum**: Axum is built on top of Tower, making it straightforward to add Tower middleware to our API endpoints.

## Implementation Requirements

### Middleware Components

- [ ] **Request Logging**: Implement detailed request/response logging with timing information
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Add configurable rate limiting for API and MCP endpoints
- [ ] **Authentication**: Implement token-based authentication for secure endpoints
- [ ] **Request Validation**: Add validation middleware for request parameters
- [ ] **Caching**: Implement response caching for frequently accessed symbols
- [ ] **Compression**: Add compression middleware for reducing response size
- [ ] **Tracing**: Implement distributed tracing for debugging complex requests

### Tower Integration Points

- [ ] **API Routes**: Apply appropriate middleware to REST API routes
- [ ] **MCP Endpoint**: Configure middleware for the MCP JSON-RPC endpoint
- [ ] **Health Check**: Exempt health check from certain middleware (e.g., auth)
- [ ] **Admin Routes**: Add additional security middleware for admin endpoints

### Configuration

- [ ] **Middleware Configuration**: Make middleware behavior configurable via env vars
- [ ] **Conditional Middleware**: Support enabling/disabling middleware based on config
- [ ] **Middleware Order**: Define optimal ordering of middleware for best performance

### Testing

- [ ] **Middleware Unit Tests**: Create tests for individual middleware components
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test middleware in the context of the full API stack
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: Measure impact of middleware on request throughput

## Future Considerations

- Custom middleware development for symbolic reasoning specific needs
- Advanced rate limiting based on user behavior and request complexity
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed symbol data
- Metrics collection for monitoring service health
