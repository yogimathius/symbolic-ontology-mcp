# Future Development Items

This document collects features and enhancements planned for future versions of the Dream Ontology MCP Server, beyond the current v1.5 MVP scope.

## Post-MVP Features

These features are planned for implementation after the v1.5 MVP is complete:

### Symbol Graph Visualization

- **Symbol Graph View (Leptos)**
  - Display network of related symbols visually
  - Allow interactive exploration of symbol relationships
  - Implement zooming and filtering for complex graphs

### User Contribution System

- **User-Contributed Dreams + AI Interpretation**

  - Submit dream → NLP parse → related symbols → interpretation synthesis
  - User feedback mechanism for improving interpretations
  - Community rating system for interpretation quality

- **Symbol Grounding Table**
  - Add structured rows of actual user context tied to symbols (`symbol_grounding`)
  - Implement validation of user-contributed examples
  - Create pipelines for enriching existing symbols with grounding data

### Content Management

- **Admin UI to Add/Update Symbols**
  - Lightweight tool to enrich the dataset over time
  - Batch import functionality for new symbol sets
  - Editorial workflow for symbol refinement

### Enhanced AI Integration

- **Advanced AI Integration**
  - Claude Plugin support for direct dream interpretation
  - GPTs integration for broader accessibility
  - Custom AI fine-tuning on symbolic understanding

## Domain Model Enhancements

- **Enrich Symbol Structure**

  - Add archetypal classifications (Hero, Shadow, Trickster)
  - Implement cultural context tagging
  - Add source attribution field for citations

- **Improve SymbolSet Relationships**
  - Add relationship types beyond simple "related"
  - Implement weighted relationships between symbols
  - Create hierarchical classification system

## Additional MCP Tools

- **Implement Core Symbol Tools**

  - `get_symbol` - Retrieve a single symbol by ID
  - `get_symbol_sets` - Retrieve sets of related symbols
  - `get_related_symbols` - Get symbols related to a given symbol

- **Add Advanced Symbol Analysis Tools**
  - `analyze_symbolic_pattern` - Identify patterns in symbol groups
  - `get_archetypal_symbols` - Get symbols by archetypal classification
  - `interpret_symbol_context` - Get contextual interpretations

## Persistence and Data Management

- **PostgreSQL Repository Enhancements**

  - Design database schema optimized for symbol queries
  - Implement repository pattern for database access
  - Create migration system for schema updates
  - Add comprehensive data validation

- **Enhance Symbol Dataset**
  - Expand to 100+ well-documented symbols
  - Add comprehensive archetypal classifications
  - Include rich interpretation contexts

## Neuro-Symbolic Integration

- **Add Ontology-Guided Reasoning**

  - Implement consistency checking for interpretations
  - Create symbolic rule enforcement system
  - Develop explanation generation for symbol relationships

- **Integrate Vector Representations**
  - Create embedding vectors for symbols
  - Implement similarity search in vector space
  - Build hybrid search combining vector and ontology approaches

## Advanced Symbolic Analysis

- **Multi-modal Symbol Recognition**

  - Research image-based symbol recognition
  - Explore audio/music symbolic interpretation
  - Design spatial/environmental symbolic analysis

- **Symbolic Storytelling Tools**
  - Implement narrative structure analysis based on archetypes
  - Create story generation guided by symbolic patterns
  - Build character arc analysis using archetypal journeys

## Community and Collaboration

- **Community Expansion of Ontology**
  - Design submission process for new symbols
  - Create moderation workflow for community additions
  - Implement versioning for the ontology

## Additional Symbolic Domains

After the MVP is complete, the platform can be extended to include:

1. **Mythology & Folklore** - Symbols from world mythologies and cultural stories
2. **Literary Symbolism** - Common symbols used in literature and poetry
3. **Religious Symbolism** - Symbols from major world religions
4. **Cultural Archetypes** - Universal archetypal patterns across cultures
5. **Psychological Symbolism** - Symbols as understood in Jungian and other psychological frameworks
