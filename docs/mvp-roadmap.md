# Symbolic Ontology MCP Server - MVP Roadmap (1.5 Month Timeline)

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features to be completed within a 1.5-month timeframe for the capstone project.

## MVP Vision

The Symbolic Ontology MCP Server will provide a flexible platform for managing and querying symbolic meanings across multiple domains. For the MVP, we'll focus on dream symbolism as the first application domain, while ensuring the architecture can easily accommodate other symbolic domains (mythology, literature, cultural archetypes, etc.) in the future.

## MVP Scope

The MVP will focus on delivering:

1. A functioning REST API for accessing symbolic ontology data
2. A working MCP server for LLM integration
3. A domain-agnostic symbolic reasoning foundation
4. Adequate test coverage for core functionality
5. Documentation for users and developers
6. Dream symbolism as the first implemented domain

## MVP Deliverables

1. **Source Code**

   - Rust codebase for API and MCP servers
   - Domain-agnostic symbol storage and retrieval system
   - Test suite for core functionality
   - Documentation and sample configurations

2. **Symbol Dataset**

   - 25+ well-documented universal symbols
   - Dream interpretation as first implemented domain
   - Schema design that supports multiple symbolic domains
   - JSON export format for reuse

3. **Documentation**

   - API documentation with domain extension guidelines
   - MCP tool documentation
   - Setup and usage guides
   - Future development roadmap for additional domains

4. **Demonstration**
   - Working API and MCP servers
   - Demo integration with Claude Desktop for dream interpretation
   - Simple web interface for browsing symbols across domains
   - Example of how to extend to new symbolic domains

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if:

1. The system provides a domain-agnostic foundation for symbolic ontology
2. Dream symbolism is fully implemented as the first domain
3. REST API provides reliable access to the symbol ontology with domain filtering
4. MCP server can be used with Claude Desktop for symbolic reasoning
5. Architecture demonstrates clear pathways for extending to additional domains
6. Core functionality is tested and reliable
7. Documentation allows new users to understand and use the system

## Non-Goals for MVP

To maintain focus and ensure timely delivery, these items are explicitly out of scope for the MVP:

1. Complete implementation of multiple symbolic domains (mythology, literature, etc.)
2. Advanced vector-based symbol relationships
3. Full PostgreSQL implementation
4. Complex authentication and authorization
5. Multi-modal symbol recognition
6. Advanced archetypal analysis tools
7. Community contribution features

These can be addressed in future development after the MVP is complete.

## Future Symbolic Domains

After the MVP is complete, the platform can be extended to include:

1. **Mythology & Folklore** - Symbols from world mythologies and cultural stories
2. **Literary Symbolism** - Common symbols used in literature and poetry
3. **Religious Symbolism** - Symbols from major world religions
4. **Cultural Archetypes** - Universal archetypal patterns across cultures
5. **Psychological Symbolism** - Symbols as understood in Jungian and other psychological frameworks

The domain-agnostic architecture developed in the MVP will make adding these domains straightforward in future iterations.
