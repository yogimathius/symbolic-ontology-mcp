# Dream Ontology MCP Server - MVP Roadmap (1.5 Month Timeline)

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features to be completed within a 1.5-month timeframe for the capstone project.

## MVP Scope

The MVP will focus on delivering:

1. A functioning REST API for accessing symbolic ontology data
2. A working MCP server for LLM integration
3. Basic symbolic reasoning features
4. Adequate test coverage for core functionality
5. Documentation for users and developers

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: Core API Functionality

- [x] **Setup API Server**

  - [x] Implement basic Axum server with health endpoint
  - [x] Create in-memory repository for symbols
  - [x] Implement GET endpoints for symbols

- [x] **MCP Server Foundation**
  - [x] Implement standalone MCP server binary
  - [x] Configure RMCP integration with basic tools
  - [x] Create run scripts for development

### Week 2: API Enhancements & MCP Tool Implementation

  - [ ] Add filtering by category and search term
  - [ ] Implement pagination for list endpoints
  - [ ] Add basic error handling and validation
- [ ] **Enhance MCP Tools**
  - [ ] Complete `get_symbols` tool with all parameters
  - [ ] Implement `get_symbol` tool for single symbol retrieval
  - [ ] Add validation and error handling for MCP tools

### Week 3: Testing & Integration

- [ ] **Implement Testing Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Create API integration tests for all endpoints
  - [ ] Build test cases for MCP tools
  - [ ] Add validation tests for error handling
- [ ] **Create Sample Integration**
  - [ ] Build demo script showing MCP client integration
  - [ ] Create sample Claude Desktop configuration
  - [ ] Implement simple query examples

### Week 4: Documentation & Symbol Dataset

- [ ] **Create Documentation**
  - [ ] Write API documentation with examples
  - [ ] Document MCP tools and configuration
  - [ ] Create setup guide for developers
- [ ] **Build Symbol Dataset**
  - [ ] Create 25+ well-documented dream symbols
  - [ ] Add basic interpretations for common contexts
  - [ ] Implement relationships between core symbols

### Week 5: Polish & Client Integration

- [ ] **Create Client Demo**
  - [ ] Build simple web interface for symbol browsing
  - [ ] Create demo of LLM integration with MCP
  - [ ] Record demonstration video
- [ ] **Final Testing & Refinement**
  - [ ] Complete end-to-end integration testing
  - [ ] Fix any bugs or usability issues
  - [ ] Optimize performance for core workflows

### Week 6 (Buffer): Presentation & Final Touches

- [ ] **Presentation Preparation**
  - [ ] Create capstone presentation materials
  - [ ] Prepare live demonstration
  - [ ] Write final documentation
- [ ] **Future Development Planning**
  - [ ] Document next steps for post-MVP development
  - [ ] Identify high-value features for next phase
  - [ ] Create scaling plan for production deployment

## MVP Deliverables

1. **Source Code**

   - Rust codebase for API and MCP servers
   - Test suite for core functionality
   - Documentation and sample configurations

2. **Symbol Dataset**

   - 25+ well-documented dream symbols
   - Basic relationships and interpretations
   - JSON export format for reuse

3. **Documentation**

   - API documentation
   - MCP tool documentation
   - Setup and usage guides
   - Future development roadmap

4. **Demonstration**
   - Working API and MCP servers
   - Demo integration with Claude Desktop
   - Simple web interface for symbol browsing

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if:

1. REST API provides reliable access to the symbol ontology
2. MCP server can be used with Claude Desktop for symbolic reasoning
3. Basic symbol dataset provides meaningful interpretations
4. Core functionality is tested and reliable
5. Documentation allows new users to understand and use the system

## Non-Goals for MVP

To maintain focus and ensure timely delivery, these items are explicitly out of scope for the MVP:

1. Advanced vector-based symbol relationships
2. Full PostgreSQL implementation
3. Complex authentication and authorization
4. Multi-modal symbol recognition
5. Advanced archetypal analysis tools
6. Community contribution features

These can be addressed in future development after the MVP is complete.
