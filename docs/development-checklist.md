# Dream Ontology MCP Server Development Checklist

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for the Dream Ontology MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server. Features are organized by priority and implementation phase.

## Current Focus Areas

These are the highest priority tasks to complete in the immediate development cycle:

### MCP Server Integration (Priority 1)

- [ ] **Connect MCP to Axum Server**

  - [ ] Add MCP endpoint to main Axum router
  - [ ] Configure JSON-RPC handling middleware
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling for MCP requests
  - [ ] Create comprehensive integration tests

- [ ] **Enhance MCP Method Implementation**
  - [ ] Complete integration of `get_symbols` MCP method
  - [ ] Add pagination support for large result sets
  - [ ] Implement parameter validation with detailed errors
  - [ ] Create unit tests for all parameter scenarios

### API Enhancements (Priority 2)

- [ ] **Improve RESTful API Testing**

  - [ ] Create comprehensive API integration tests
  - [ ] Test all error scenarios and edge cases
  - [ ] Add benchmarking for API performance

- [ ] **Add API Documentation**
  - [ ] Implement OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  - [ ] Add example requests and responses
  - [ ] Create usage guides for all endpoints

## Near-Term Development

Features to be implemented after completing the current focus areas:

### Domain Model Enhancements

- [ ] **Enrich Symbol Structure**

  - [ ] Add archetypal classifications (Hero, Shadow, Trickster)
  - [ ] Implement cultural context tagging
  - [ ] Add source attribution field for citations

- [ ] **Improve SymbolSet Relationships**
  - [ ] Add relationship types beyond simple "related"
  - [ ] Implement weighted relationships between symbols
  - [ ] Create hierarchical classification system

### Additional MCP Methods

- [ ] **Implement Core Symbol Methods**
  - [ ] `get_symbol` - Retrieve a single symbol by ID
  - [ ] `get_symbol_sets` - Retrieve sets of related symbols
  - [ ] `get_related_symbols` - Get symbols related to a given symbol
- [ ] **Add Advanced Symbol Analysis**
  - [ ] `analyze_symbolic_pattern` - Identify patterns in symbol groups
  - [ ] `get_archetypal_symbols` - Get symbols by archetypal classification
  - [ ] `interpret_symbol_context` - Get contextual interpretations

## Mid-Term Goals

Features planned for implementation after the near-term goals:

### Persistence and Data Management

- [ ] **Implement PostgreSQL Repository**

  - [ ] Design database schema optimized for symbol queries
  - [ ] Implement repository pattern for database access
  - [ ] Create migration system for schema updates
  - [ ] Add comprehensive data validation

- [ ] **Enhance Symbol Dataset**
  - [ ] Expand to 100+ well-documented symbols
  - [ ] Add comprehensive archetypal classifications
  - [ ] Include rich interpretation contexts

### Neuro-Symbolic Integration

- [ ] **Add Ontology-Guided Reasoning**

  - [ ] Implement consistency checking for interpretations
  - [ ] Create symbolic rule enforcement system
  - [ ] Develop explanation generation for symbol relationships

- [ ] **Integrate Vector Representations**
  - [ ] Create embedding vectors for symbols
  - [ ] Implement similarity search in vector space
  - [ ] Build hybrid search combining vector and ontology approaches

## Long-Term Vision

Features that represent the advanced capabilities we aim to build:

### Advanced Symbolic Analysis

- [ ] **Multi-modal Symbol Recognition**

  - [ ] Research image-based symbol recognition
  - [ ] Explore audio/music symbolic interpretation
  - [ ] Design spatial/environmental symbolic analysis

- [ ] **Symbolic Storytelling Tools**
  - [ ] Implement narrative structure analysis based on archetypes
  - [ ] Create story generation guided by symbolic patterns
  - [ ] Build character arc analysis using archetypal journeys

### Community and Collaboration

- [ ] **Community Expansion of Ontology**
  - [ ] Design submission process for new symbols
  - [ ] Create moderation workflow for community additions
  - [ ] Implement versioning for the ontology

## Development Principles

Throughout all development phases, we adhere to these principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Every feature starts with tests
2. **Clean Architecture**: Maintain separation of domain, application, and infrastructure concerns
3. **Documentation**: All public APIs and methods have clear documentation
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
5. **Performance**: Regular performance testing and optimization

> **Next Actions**: Complete the MCP Server Integration tasks marked as Priority 1, followed by the API Enhancements in Priority 2.
