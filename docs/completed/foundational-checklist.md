# Foundational Checklist (COMPLETED)

This checklist tracks the foundational components that have been implemented in the Dream Ontology MCP project.

## Revised Foundational Building Checklist

### 1. Improve Testing Foundation (FIRST PRIORITY)

- [x] **Refactor Tests into Separate Modules**

  - [x] Create `tests/` directory with proper structure
    - [x] `tests/domain/` for testing domain models
    - [x] `tests/api/` for testing API endpoints
    - [x] `tests/mcp/` for testing MCP handlers
    - [x] `tests/llm/` for testing LLM integration
  - [x] Move unit tests from in-file to dedicated test modules
  - [x] Create shared test utilities and fixtures

- [x] **Create Test Fixtures and Helpers**

  - [x] Implement test data factory functions
  - [x] Create mock repositories for testing handlers
  - [x] Add test context setup/teardown utilities

- [x] **Expand Test Coverage**
  - [x] Add tests for current placeholder functionality
  - [x] Write tests for error cases and edge conditions
  - [x] Create integration tests between components

### 2. Complete Core Domain Implementation

- [x] **Finalize Symbol and SymbolSet models**

  - [x] Review and validate the current fields against requirements
  - [x] Add any missing validators or business logic
  - [x] Ensure proper error handling in methods

- [x] **Create a Repository Trait and Implementation**
  - [x] Define `SymbolRepository` trait with CRUD operations
  - [x] Implement in-memory version for development/testing
  - [x] Add proper error types for repository operations

### 3. Improve Error Handling

- [x] **Create Domain-Specific Error Types**

  - [x] Define error enum with meaningful variants
  - [x] Implement proper error conversion traits
  - [x] Add context to errors for better debugging

- [x] **Implement Error Mapping**
  - [x] Map domain errors to API responses
  - [x] Map repository errors to service errors
  - [x] Add proper HTTP status codes to API errors

### 4. Connect Components and Remove Placeholders

- [x] **Complete MCP Handler Implementation**

  - [x] Inject repository into `GetSymbolsHandler`
  - [x] Implement actual symbol retrieval logic
  - [x] Add proper error mapping to MCP protocol errors

- [x] **Complete API Handlers**

  - [x] Connect API handlers to repositories
  - [x] Implement proper response mapping
  - [x] Add validation for incoming requests

### 5. Add Missing Infrastructure

- [x] **Implement Configuration Management**

  - [x] Create configuration struct for app settings
  - [x] Add environment variable loading
  - [x] Set up defaults for development

- [x] **Enhance Logging**
  - [x] Add structured logging for important operations
  - [x] Configure appropriate log levels
  - [x] Add request/response logging for debugging

### 6. Create Initial Symbol Dataset

- [x] **Develop a Basic Symbol Dataset**

  - [x] Create a small set of well-documented symbols (10-15)
  - [x] Include sample interpretations in multiple contexts
  - [x] Add relationships between symbols for testing
