## ðŸŒŸ **Capstone-Specific Expansion (Based on your project)**

Given your ongoing development of a symbolic ontology ("The Major Arcana of AI Meaning"), integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, and leveraging Rust/Wasm (Leptos frontend, Axum backend):

### âœ… **Primary Focus: Symbolic Ontology Grounding for LLMs**

- Architecting robust symbolic ontologies for interpretive depth (mythopoetic, Jungian archetypes).
- Enhancing LLM fidelity and trust via structured symbolic grounding (MCP integrations).
- Neuro-symbolic and ontology-based explainability frameworks for AI meaning interpretation.

### âœ… **Complementary Technical Domains:**

- **Rust-Wasm Integration and Optimization:**

  - Deep dive into fine-grained Rust/Wasm interoperability (web-sys improvements, Leptos SSR/CSR).
  - Performance optimization techniques specifically in the Rust-to-Wasm toolchain.
  - Benchmarking and improvements in full-stack Rust frameworks utilizing Wasm.

- **Fine-Grained Functional & Symbolic Execution:**
  - Implementing fine-grained symbolic programming paradigms to enhance interpretive accuracy.
  - Leveraging compositional symbolic execution for backend logic clarity and reliability.
  - Optimizing memory/object representation for symbolic processing in Rust/Wasm ecosystems.

### âœ… **Interdisciplinary Synergies:**

- Integration of computational psychology (Jungian archetypes) into symbolic ontology.
- Context-driven architectures enhancing interpretive AI (e.g., MCP retrieval augmentation).
- Embodied cognitive frameworks to ground symbolic interpretation methods in intuitive meaning.
