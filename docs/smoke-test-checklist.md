I'll test both servers with requests to see their current functionality. Let me first check their status and then make requests to the API and MCP servers.

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/health
```

Great, the API server is running. Let's test the symbols endpoint:

```bash
curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' http://127.0.0.1:3000/symbols | jq
```

Let's try the endpoint without using `jq` to see the raw output:

```bash
curl -s -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' http://127.0.0.1:3000/symbols
```

Let's check if we can reach an individual symbol:

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/symbols/water
```

Now let's test the MCP server. We need to understand the proper format for MCP requests:

Read file: src/mcp/methods/get_symbols.rs
Let's see the parameters expected by the get_symbols method:

Read file: src/mcp/schema.rs
Now I'm going to test the MCP server by sending a request to the get_symbols method. First, let's format a correct MCP request:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":"test-request","method":"get_symbols","params":{}}' http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp | cat
```

It appears the response might be empty or having formatting issues with the server-sent events. Let's try another approach with a more compatible client:

```bash
cargo add -D reqwest --features=json
```

```bash
cargo add --dev reqwest --features=json
```

Let's create a simple test script to test the MCP Server:

```rust yew:scripts/test_mcp.rs
use reqwest;
use serde_json::{json, Value};
use tokio;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    println!("Testing MCP server on http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp");

    let client = reqwest::Client::new();

    // Create a standard JSON-RPC request for get_symbols
    let request = json!({
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": "test-request",
        "method": "get_symbols",
        "params": {
            "limit": 10
        }
    });

    println!("Sending request: {}", request);

    // Send the request and get the response
    let response = client
        .post("http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp")
        .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
        .json(&request)
        .send()
        .await?;

    let status = response.status();
    let headers = response.headers().clone();
    let body = response.text().await?;

    println!("Status: {}", status);
    println!("Headers: {:#?}", headers);
    println!("Body: {}", body);

    // Parse the body as needed - this might be tricky with SSE format

    Ok(())
}
```

Now let's run the test script:

```bash
cargo run --bin mcp_server & sleep 2 && cargo run --bin dream-ontology-mcp & sleep 2
```

Let's run our test script:

```bash
cargo run --script scripts/test_mcp.rs
```

Let's create a proper binary for our test:

```rust yew:src/bin/test_mcp.rs
use reqwest;
use serde_json::{json, Value};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    println!("Testing MCP server on http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp");

    let client = reqwest::Client::new();

    // Create a standard JSON-RPC request for get_symbols
    let request = json!({
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "id": "test-request",
        "method": "get_symbols",
        "params": {
            "limit": 10
        }
    });

    println!("Sending request: {}", request);

    // Send the request and get the response
    let response = client
        .post("http://127.0.0.1:3001/mcp")
        .header("Content-Type", "application/json")
        .json(&request)
        .send()
        .await?;

    let status = response.status();
    let headers = response.headers().clone();
    let body = response.text().await?;

    println!("Status: {}", status);
    println!("Headers: {:#?}", headers);
    println!("Body: {}", body);

    Ok(())
}
```

```bash
cargo run --bin test_mcp
```

We need to make reqwest available to the binary. Let's update the Cargo.toml file:

```plain text:Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "dream-ontology-mcp"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2024"

# Add lib section to expose our code for integration tests
[lib]
name = "dream_ontology_mcp"
path = "src/lib.rs"

[[test]]
name = "integration"
path = "tests/lib.rs"

[dependencies]
anyhow = "1.0.98"
async-trait = "0.1.88"
axum = "0.8.3"
axum-macros = "0.5.0"
reqwest = { version = "0.12.15", features = ["json"] }
rmcp = { version = "0.1.5", features = ["server", "transport-sse-server"] }
serde = "1.0.219"
serde_json = { version = "1.0.140", features = ["preserve_order"] }
tokio = { version = "1.44.2", features = ["full", "macros"] }
tower-http = { version = "0.6.2", features = ["trace"] }
tracing = "0.1.41"
tracing-subscriber = { version = "0.3.19", features = ["env-filter"] }

[dev-dependencies]
hyper = { version = "1.6.0", features = ["full"] }
tokio = { version = "1.44.2", features = ["macros", "rt-multi-thread"] }
tokio-test = "0.4.4"
tower = "0.5.2"
```

```bash
cargo run --bin test_mcp
```

It looks like the MCP server is not responding correctly (404 Not Found). Let's first check if the MCP server is actually running:

```bash
ps aux | grep mcp_server
```

The MCP server is running, but there seems to be an issue with the endpoint. Let's examine the source for the MCP server:

Read file: src/bin/mcp_server.rs
Let's also examine the SymbolService implementation:

Read file: src/mcp/service.rs
Based on all the information I've gathered, let me create a revised checklist for your MVP. First, I'll summarize what's working and what needs improvement.

## Current State of the Dream Ontology MCP Project

   - ✅ The MCP server and API server are properly separated

2. **API Server**

   - ✅ Basic Axum server with health endpoint working
   - ❌ Symbol endpoints are returning empty responses (need to debug)
   - ❌ Missing pagination and filtering implementation

3. **MCP Server**

   - ✅ Server running on correct port
   - ❌ Endpoint (mcp/) not responding correctly (404 error)
   - ❌ Need to properly implement the get_symbols method in the RMCP format

4. **Data Model**

   - ✅ Symbol domain model implemented
