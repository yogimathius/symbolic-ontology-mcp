# Symbol Ontology Documentation

Welcome to the Symbol Ontology project documentation. This repository organizes all documentation resources for understanding, using, and developing the Symbol Ontology MCP Server.

## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized into the following sections:

### üìê Architecture

- [System Overview](./architecture/overview.md) - High-level architecture and component relationships
- [Tech Stack](./architecture/tech-stack.md) - Technical components and implementation details

### üî¨ Research

- [Research Papers](./research/papers.md) - Curated collection of academic papers relevant to the project
- [Symbolic Reasoning](./research/symbolic-reasoning.md) - Key concepts in symbolic reasoning and ontologies

### üõ† Development

- [V2 Roadmap](./development/v2-roadmap.md) - Planned features and improvements for version 2
- [Implementation Guide](./development/implementation-guide.md) - Technical guidance for developers

### üìö Usage

- [MCP Prompt Templates](./usage/mcp-prompt-templates.md) - Templates for effective use of the Symbol Ontology MCP

## Quick Start

The Symbol Ontology project consists of two main components:

1. **Symbol Ontology MCP Server** (this repository) - Provides symbolic knowledge through the Model Context Protocol
2. **Dream Interpretation Client** (separate repository) - Consumes symbolic data and integrates with LLMs

To get started:

1. Review the [System Overview](./architecture/overview.md) to understand the architecture
2. Explore the [MCP Prompt Templates](./usage/mcp-prompt-templates.md) to learn how to interact with the system
3. Check the [V2 Roadmap](./development/v2-roadmap.md) for upcoming features and improvements

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to both the codebase and documentation. If you're interested in contributing:

1. Review the existing documentation to understand the system
2. Check the [V2 Roadmap](./development/v2-roadmap.md) for planned improvements
3. Submit pull requests with clear descriptions of changes or improvements
