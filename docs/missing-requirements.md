# Missing Pieces Analysis for MVP v1.5

## API Layer (Axum)

### ✅ Implemented:

- Health check route
- `/symbols` with filtering for limit, query, and category
- `/symbols/{id}` endpoint to get a symbol by ID
- Basic interpretation endpoint at `/interpret`

### ❌ Missing:

1. **Related Symbols Endpoint**: Need to add `/symbols/{id}/related` endpoint
2. **Categories Endpoint**: Need to implement `/categories` to support UI dropdowns
3. **Improved Search**: Fulltext search for better symbol matching

## MCP Server

### ✅ Implemented:

- MCP server with basic structure
- JSON-RPC method for `get_symbols`

### ❌ Missing:

1. **MCP Path Fix**: The MCP endpoint returns 404, needs fixing
2. **Error Handling**: Proper JSON-RPC error responses for invalid requests
3. **Related Symbols**: MCP endpoint for fetching related symbols

## Database & Seeding

### ✅ Implemented:

- PostgreSQL setup with pgvector
- CSV seeding for dream symbols

### ❌ Missing:

1. **Mythological Symbol Seed Set**: Add 10-20 mythological symbols
2. **ConceptNet Hydration**: Enrich a few universal symbols with external data
3. **Vector Embeddings**: Confirm pgvector search is working

## Leptos Frontend

### ✅ Implemented:

- Basic project structure seems to be in place

### ❌ Missing (the whole frontend):

1. **Symbol List**: Responsive list of symbols with basic details
2. **Symbol Detail View**: Complete view of symbol with interpretations
3. **Search & Filter UI**: Interface for searching and filtering
4. **Categories Selection**: Dropdown for filtering by category
5. **Dark Mode Toggle**: Simple UI enhancement

## Interpretation Logic

### ✅ Implemented:

- Basic `/interpret` endpoint structure

### ❌ Missing:

1. **Symbol Matching**: Add basic NLP to match symbols in dream text
2. **Enhanced Interpretation**: Connection to proper LLM for interpretation
3. **Symbol Highlighting**: Identify symbols in input text

# Implementation Plan for a 6-Week Timeline
